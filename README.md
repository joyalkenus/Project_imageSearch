# 🌟 Project_imageSearch 🌟

Welcome to Project_imageSearch 👀, a passion-driven project that's all about revolutionizing the way you search for images on your computer.

## 🚀 What is Project_imageSearch?

Project_imageSearch combines the realm of advanced image recognition 🖼️ and deep learning 🧠. 
At its core, this project harnesses the power of cutting-edge image captioning models like RAM (Recognize Anything Model), developed by the brilliant Xinyu Huang, combined with the robust capabilities of Large Language Models to develop a unique searching system.

## 🎯 The Goal

The mission is simple yet ambitious: to create an image search software that can effortlessly find images on your local system using just user input.
-  Imagine typing a description and getting the exact image you have in mind  that's the magic I'm working to achieve!

## 🔍 How It Works

Here's a sneak peek into the technical wizardry behind Project_imageSearch:

- **Deep Learning models for image tags**: We use the RAM model to delve into the nuances of any image, capturing details that go beyond the pixels.
- **Language Understanding**: Large language models come into play, interpreting your descriptions and connecting them with the right images.

- To run the model and test it out. use the run.ipynb file. replace the google drive mount to your drive link and give the path to your gallery of images.
- let me know how it performs on your pictures. Im Curious.
## 🙌 Get Involved

I'm on a journey, and I'd love for you to join me. Whether you're a developer, a tech enthusiast, or just someone who loves images, your contributions and feedback are invaluable.
